# Cost functions determine how far off a solution is from optimum

We use this in [[Machine Learning]] to understand how well tweaking different paramaters of a soulition improves its performance, in order to apply [[Gradient Descent]]

Higher cost = Worse performance

## Algorithms

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): $\dfrac{1}{n}\sum{(y_e-y_a)^2}$.
