# Ghist

Supervised learning is a method of [[Machine Learning]] in which input data is only trained on inputs, without [[Labels]], in contrast to [[Supervised Learning]]

# Advantages/Disadvantages

Unsupervised learning doesn't require any labeled data that has been done manually, which allows it to work on large data sets that havent been labeled. 

However, without labels, it can be difficult to discover how well the model is performing. It's also hard to make specific predictions given that labeling data isn't present.
