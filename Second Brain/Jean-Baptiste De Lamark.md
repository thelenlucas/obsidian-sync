An early [[Biologist]] that investicated [[Species]] turning into other species, pulling from [[Domestic Species]] as evidence. A very early, and flawed perspecive on [[Evolution]]. 

# Lamarkian Evolution

This is evolution in which species evolve though the use and disuse of qcquired traits. However, there isn't real suupport of this theory, given items such as [[Bonsai]]s. Potentially could be vinidacted in [[Epigenetics]].
