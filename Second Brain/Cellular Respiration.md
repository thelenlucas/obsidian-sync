# The Ghist
This is the process in which [[Cell]] turn [[Glucose]] into [[ATP]], and thus produce usable work. It mainly occurs in the [[Mitcochondion]], an important [[Organell]].

The entire process takes in [[Molecular Oxygen]] and exports [[Water]] and [[Carbon Dioxide]]. All other factors are completely recycled, barring [[Cellular Fermentation]]. In aoxgienic conditions.

# The Bio wetwork
1. [[Glycolosys]] occurs outside of the Mitochondrion, passing [[Pyruvate]] into the mitochondria, and outputing four ATP per two ATP and one glucose entered$$C_6H_{12}O_{16} +2ATP \rightarrow 2C_3H_4O_3+4ATP$$
2. The [[Citric Acid Cycle]] chains [[Acetyle CoA]] from Pyruvate, then strips its electrons to use in the third chain, producing $CO_2$ and an ATP molecule.  Six NADH and two FADH$_2$ electron carriers are also produced.
3. [[Oxidative Phosphoration]] occurs via [[Electron Transport]]. The electrons extracted during the process is transported to the electron carriers on the inside of the inner layer of the mitochondrion. Each step on the trip extracts some of the potential energy from the electron to pump H+ ions to a low concentration. This gradient then moves back across the membrane to generate ATP over a turbine called [[ATP Synthase]].
