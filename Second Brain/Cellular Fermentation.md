# Ghist
Cells may process [[Pyruvate]] in the absence of [[Molecular Oxygen]]. In [[Yeast]] this results in [[Ethenol]] and [[Carbon Dioxide]]. In [[Eukariotic Cell]] like [[Human]]s, it results in [[Lactate]]. It also

# Alcohol Fermentation
First, [[Glycolosys]] occurs. Without the ability for [[Oxidative Phosphoration]] to occur due to lack of [[Molecular Oxygen]], the cell would run out of [[NADH]] to use in this process, and Glycolosys would stop. [[NADH]] may be used to split pyruvate down into [[Carbon Dioxide]] and [[Ethenol]], converting the [[NADH]] back into [[NAD+]], allowing the cycle to continue.

# Lactic Acid Fermentation
LAF occurs in much the same way as Alcohol Fermentation, however, it produces [[Lactate]] instead of [[Ethenol]], and does not produce [[Carbon Dioxide]].
