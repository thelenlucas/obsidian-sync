# Ghist
The attempt to create [[Artificial Intelligence]] via creating a symbolic language of thought and refining it through obervation and inference. Implimentation attempts include the [[Programming Language]] [[LISP]].

# Requirements
In essence, there are only two things required for a symbolic language:

1. Atomic Symbols that can combine in different ways
2. A determination of system from combinations of the atomic symbols.

Following these, a system can be written to extract behavior from these systems, and ideally to modify them as well, provided the language:

1. Contains a set of atomicc symbols, that can bet strung to yield a structure
2. Can be formed into many such strucutres that may be formed
3. The state of the assembly may be related in a consistent manner to an external world larger than itself

Actually creating a symbolic language is not terribly difficult. In all essenses it is simply a referential programming language, with a few modificications. Even this document would technically fit come of the criteria of a symbol-system approach, given its mode of hyperlinking.^[1]
