A matrix is a construct within [[Linear Algebra]] that allows for the combination and solving of systems of [[Linear Equation]]s. It consists of a series of rows and colums that may be of dimensions $n > 0$. Higher dimensional arrays also exist, largely within [[Computer Science]].

# Representation
Matrixes are represented as a group of indices, that may be referenced to find the value of a number in that position. Row comes first, and then column. In practice, the matrix looks like $$
\begin{matrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{matrix}$$
