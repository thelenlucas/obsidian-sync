A [[Biologist]] who greatly advanced the theory of [[Evolution]] and, and created the most commonly accepted mechanism of evolution today, [[Natural Selection]].

Went to Edinburgh to study medicen, left for Christ College at Cambridge to become clergy, as that was the best way to gain a naturalist's education.

Made two major points:
1. Current species are descendants of previous species
2. Proposed [[Natural Selection]] as a method for this divergence
