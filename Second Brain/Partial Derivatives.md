Partials are [[Derivative]] of functions with multiple inputs related to only a single input. This results in the ability to take multiple partials for each given input variable to a function.

In essentiality, $\dfrac{\delta f}{\delta x}$ is fairly easy to compute. Simply take a normal derivation, and perform it, treating all other variables as constants within the function. For example $$\dfrac{\delta f}{\delta x}[3xy^2+2x^2y+4y]=3y^2+4xy$$There are also some special applications of normal rules, called [[Partial Derivatives Rules]]
