Cin in [[C++]] is a [[Data Stream]] that allows for the extraction of information from user prompts. By default it is used as `cin >> variable`. This attempts to auto-convert fields to items, and skips over spaces.

# cin.get()
[[cin.get()]] will grab the next set of characters in the stream (including whitespace) as `cin.get(stringname, len)`
