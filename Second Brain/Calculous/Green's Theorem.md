In it's ismplest terms, green's thoerem allows us an easier way to calculate the [[Circulation]] of a path, though it only applies to [[Vector Field]]'s that are [[Conservative]]. It states that
$$\oint_{C}Mdx+Ndy\space ds=\int\int_{D}\frac{\delta N}{\delta x}-\frac{\delta M}{\delta y}dA$$This is the [[Flow]] version, and lets us rewrite $$\oint_{C}F_{x}r_{x}'(t)+F_{y}r_{y}'(t)dt=\int\int_{R}\frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta x}-\frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta y}dA$$This can simplify many flow circulations. It can also be applied to [[Flux]]  in the form $$\oint_C F\cdot n=\int\int_{R} \frac{\delta F_x}{\delta x}+ \frac{\delta F_y}{\delta y}dA$$This makes certain [[Circulation]] problems are easier, though it only works on [[Conservative]] [[Force Field]]s
