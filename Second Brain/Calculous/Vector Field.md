# Ghist
A vector field, also known as a [[Force Field]], is a concept that allows for the construction of fields in space, based on the location in space of a point. It typically takes the form $F(n)$, where $n$ may be any number of dimensions, reprisented in space. 

# Integrating
When we wish to find the [[Flow]] or [[Flux]] of a vector field across a force field, we may construct an [[Integral]] across the field, such as $$Flow=\int \vec F\cdot d\vec r\space$$

# Conservation
A vector field is conservative if it is path-indipendant. That is, if we take a [[Line Integral]] between any two points, that value will remain the same, regardless of the path taken to get there. In general, two main points imply conservation:

1. The [[Circulation]] $\oint \vec F \cdot d\vec r=0$
2. $F$ is a [[Gradient Field]] for some function so that $F=\nabla f$

Conservation also implies both of these two facts.
