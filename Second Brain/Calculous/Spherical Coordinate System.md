# Ghist
Spherical coordinates are a [[Coordinate System]] that represent a point in space using an ordered triple $$(\rho,\phi,\theta)$$
1. $\rho$ is the difference from $P$ to the origin
2. $\phi$ is the angle $OP$ makes with a the $z$-axis ($0\leq \phi \leq \pi$) 
3. $\theta$ is the angle from [[Cylindrical Coordinate System]]

# Volume
We can take the volume of spherical coordinates using $$\int\int\int{(\rho^2\sin\phi)} d\rho d\phi d\theta$$
