# The Ghist
We can use a doulbe integral system to find the average value of a function $f(x,y)$.

# The mathmatics
This is a simple calculation of $$f_a=\dfrac{1}{A_R}\int\int_RfdA$$
# Examples
## Example 1: Average value of $f(x,y)=xcosxy$ over the region $0<=R<=\pi, 0<=y<=1$.

$$f_a=\dfrac{\int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{1}{xcos(xy)dydx}}{\pi}$$Regions are just a rectangle, and that makes finding $A_R$ easy. In the future we may need to find [[Areas Via 2D Integration]].
