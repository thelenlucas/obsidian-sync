# Ghist

Stacks are a type of [[Data Structure]] that consists of a series of data types in a linear list. Items that are entered lasta re removed first.

# Methods

| Operation      | purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `push(value)`  | Adds an element to the top of the stack                      |
| `pop()`        | Removes an element from the top of the stack, and returns it |
| `top()/peek()` | Returns the top of the stack                                 |
| `empty()`      | Returns the status of the stack                              |

Note that one of the advantages of the stack is that all of these operations complete in $O(1)$ time complexity.

Stacks are very fast, but implimenting any sort of modification to data further down in the stack is difficult, to say the leaset.
