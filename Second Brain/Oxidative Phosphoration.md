# Ghist
A process that turns [[Electon]]s from [[Electron Carriers]] into usable [[ATP]] via [[Electron Transport]] and [[ATP Synthase]]

# The Bio

## Difference between NADH and FADH$_2$
NADH is more effecient, supplying roughly +8 kcal/mol more energy. Additionally, more NADH is performed in the [[Citric Acid Cycle]].

## Without Oxygen
Without O$_2$, the [[Electron Transport]] proteins will remain charged, and the process will halt.
