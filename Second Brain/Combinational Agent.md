This agent has a common structure of [[Forward-Forward Network]]s and discrete computational blocks.

For safeties sake, and for ease of standardization across multiple learning tasks, this agent takes in only text and returns only text. Ideally the network is then trained to understand interpritations on the environment given through text, and has a signal output to give end of calculation.
