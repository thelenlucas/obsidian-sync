In [[C++]], the input buffer, known as istream, is a [[Data Stream]] that includes [[C++ Files]] and [[cin]]. It has a variety of operators such as the cin operators, but several others as well.

* ignore() ignores characters in the buffer by the amount specified
* peek() grabs the next char, but does not remove it from the buffer
* putback() inserts a char into the beginning of the buffer
