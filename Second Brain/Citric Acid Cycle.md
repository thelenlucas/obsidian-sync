# Ghist
The citric acid cycle is the second step in [[Cellular Respiration]]. It takes [[Pyruvate]] from [[Glycolosys]], and forms [[Acetyle CoA]] out of it. Then, on the inside of the inner membrane of the [[Mitcochondion]], it attatches the molecule into a new skeleton form. Then, [[Electron Carriers]] (both [[NAD+]] and [[FAD]]) strip the electrons, breaking off [[Carbon]] atoms, combining them with [[Water]], and forming [[Carbon Dioxide]]. The electron carriers then pass onto the [[Electron Transport]] chain
