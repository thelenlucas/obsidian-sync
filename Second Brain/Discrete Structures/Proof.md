In [[Discrete Mathematics]], proofs help us determine that certain facts about the world are absolutely true, given a set of paramaters. They can be extremely frustrating, and consist of a series of steps proven one after each other to determine the truth of a statement. There are several kinds:

1. [[Exhaustive Proof]]s
2. [[Direct Proof]]s
3. [[Contradictive Proof]]s
4. [[Contraposition Proof]]s
