# Ghist

In [[Mathematics]], a set is a collection of unordered items. [[Elements]], or Members, of a set are contained within it. A set may be defined $$X=\left\{a,b,c,d \right\}$$We can say that $a\in\{a,b,c,d\}$ and that $e\notin \{a,b,c,d\}$. To define a repeating pattern we can designate the inbetweens with $...$, this, for the natural number set $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,...\}$. We can also use the set builder function, where the set being described contains all items in a seperate set that satisfy the stated requirement:$$\mathbb{N}^{+}={\{x\in\mathbb{N}:x>0\}}$$In this case $\mathbb{N}^+$ is the natural set besides $0$.

## Common Sets

* The [[Natural Number]] set $\mathbb{N}=\{x:x\ge0\}$
* The [[Integer]] set $\mathbb{Z} = \{x:x\in\mathbb{N}\space \text{or}-x\in\mathbb{N}\}$
* That [[Rational]] set $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}:a\in\mathbb{Z}, b\in\mathbb{Z}, b\ne0\}$

# Set Oporations

We define several common operations on sets, the Union, the Intersection and the Difference:

* $A\cup B = \left\{x:x\in A \text{or} \space x\in B\right\}$
