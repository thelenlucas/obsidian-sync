# Ghist

In [[Mathematics]], a set is a collection of unordered items, called [[Elements]]. Members of a set are contained within it. A set may be defined $$X=\left\{a,b,c,d \right\}$$We can say that $a\in\{a,b,c,d\}$ and that $e\notin \{a,b,c,d\}$. To define a repeating pattern we can designate the inbetweens with $...$, this, for the natural number set $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,...\}$. We can also use the set builder function, where the set being described contains all items in a seperate set that satisfy the stated requirement:$$\mathbb{N}^{+}={\{x\in\mathbb{N}:x>0\}}$$In this case $\mathbb{N}^+$ is the natural set besides $0$.

## Common Sets

* The [[Natural Number]] set $\mathbb{N}=\{x:x\ge0\}$
* The [[Integer]] set $\mathbb{Z} = \{x:x\in\mathbb{N}\space \text{or}-x\in\mathbb{N}\}$
* That [[Rational]] set $\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{a}{b}:a\in\mathbb{Z}, b\in\mathbb{Z}, b\ne0\}$
* $\emptyset$ the set that contains nothing
* $C$ the set of complex numbers

## Predicate inclusion
$$S=\{x:p(x)\}$$Every item in $S$ has property $p$, and every item with propoerty $p$ is in $S$.

### Examples

* $\{x:x\text{ is a month with 30 days}\}$
* $\{x:x\text{ is an integer and } 4 < x < 9\}$
* $\{1,4,9,16\}$
	* $\{x:\text{ x is one of the first four perfect squares}\}$

# Set Oporetions

We define several common operations on sets, the Union2, the Intersection and the Difference:

| Item                 | Name         | Definition                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $A\cup B$            | Union        | Items in $A$ and items in $B$                                                |
| $A\cap B$            | Intersection | Items                                                                        |
| $A=B$                | Equality     | $(\forall x)[(x\in A \rightarrow x \in B)\wedge (x\in B\rightarrow x\in A)]$ |
| Cup thingy with line | Superset     | THe opposit of a subset                                                      |
| Right cup no line    | Subset       | Denotes proper subset                                                        |
| Absolute value set   | Cardnality   | Number of objects in set                                                     |
