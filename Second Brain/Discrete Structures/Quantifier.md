Quantifiers are tools of [[Formal Logic]] that allow us to make conclusions about ranges of objects, instead off the single cases in [[Propositional Logic]]. They are always grouped in parenthases in order to specify their paired variable $$(\forall x)(P(x))$$ They come in two main forms:

# Forms
## [[Universal Quantifier]]
The [[Universal Quantifier]] $\forall$, symbolizes "for all", "for every", "for any", and allows claims to be made across the entire domain of the variable used. The claim "all of the intigers are greather than or equal to zero" reads$$(\forall x)(x\ge 0)$$if $x$'s domain is $\mathbb{Z}$.

## [[Existential Quantifier]]
The [[Existential Quantifier]] $\exists$, makes the claim that "for one", or "for some". It does not span the entire domain. This is often used to specify part of the domain. For example, if the domain is the real numbers, the statement "some of the natural numbers are above zero" reads:$$(\exists x)(x>0)$$
