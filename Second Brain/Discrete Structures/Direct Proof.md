# Ghist

In [[Discrete Mathematics]], many of our proofs can be discribed in a series of direct connections. We may, for example wish to describe $\text{for all } x(P(x)\rightarrow Q(x))$. To create a direct proof, we first create the structure, then fill in the details.

To prove a theorem in this manner, we simply assume that $P\rightarrow Q$, and attempt to prove that that is the case.

# Example

Prove: For any intiger $n$ if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even.

Let $n$ be some arbitrary intiger. Suppose that $n$ is even. Then, $n=2k$, where $k$ is some other intiger. Now, $n^{2} = (2k)^{2}= 2(2k^2)$. Therefore, $n^2$ is even, because $2(2k^2)$ is divisible by two.
