# Ghist

A proposition is a [[Logic]]al statment in [[Discrete Mathematics]] that can be either true or false. It must be true or false and no other values.

Compound propositions may be constructed with [[Boolean Operators]]. For example, a porposition could be "This flower is blue **and** has a stem".



# Properties

| Property     | Definition                                                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assosiative  | The way in which operations can be grouped, e.g. (A ∧ B) ∧ C = A ∧ (B ∧ C).                   |
| Communitive  | The order of the operands doesn't affect the result of the operation, e.g. A ∧ B = B ∧ A.     |
| Distributive | The way in which one operation distributes over another, e.g. A ∧ (B ∨ C) = (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) |
| Identity     | A ∧ 1 = A / A ∨ 0 = A                                                                         |
| Negation     | ¬(A ∧ B) = ¬A ∨ ¬B / ¬(A ∨ B) = ¬A ∧ ¬B                                                       |
| Domination   | 0 ∧ A = 0 / 1 ∨ A = 1                                                                         |
