The greatest common denominator of two numbers is the largest intiger that divides two intigers evenly. It can be found using the [[Euclidian Method]], among others.

Interestingly, the gcd of two numbers can be written as a linear combination of those two numbers. Thus, we can also characterize the gcd as being the smallest positive value of a linear combination of two numbers.

If two numbers have a gcd of one, then they are relatively prime.
