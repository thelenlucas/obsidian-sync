# Ghist

Translation is the process of turning english statements into [[Predicate String]]s in order to evaluate their [[Validity]].

# Examples

### "Every Parrot is Ugly" -> "For any thing, if that thing is a parrot, that thing is ugly"
$$(\forall x)(P(x) \rightarrow U(x))$$

### "Some Parrots are Ugly" -> "For some objects, if that object is a parrot, then that thing is ugly"
$$(\exists x)(P(x) \rightarrow U(x))$$
