# Ghist

The second principle of [[Logical Induction]] is similar to the [[First Principle of Induction]], but differs in it's exact working. It's a pain in the butt to use, but its very powerful. For some proposal $P(n)$:

1. $P(1) \text{ is true}$
2. $(\forall k)[P(r)\text{ true for all } r, 1\le r \le k\rightarrow P(k+1) \text{ true}]$

Implies $P(n)$ is true for all positive intigers.

# Explenation

Statement 2 differes frmo the [[First Principle of Induction]]. In the first principle we assume some arbitrary value is true then expan dthat value. In the second principle we assume a range of values is true, and then expand that range.
