Like [[Linear Regression]],non-linear regression uses a non-linear [[Function]] as it's regression function. This allows for more flexible  data fits, but it can be harder to understand, and [[Gradient Descent]] can be harder to enact. Any function that is non-linear meets this requirment, so most regression algorithms meet this criteara, such as [[Neural Network]]s.
