Flow is a measure of how well a [[Line Integral]] or a [[Circulation]] "lines up" with a [[Vector Field]]. When passed against a [[Force Field]], this becomes a measure of [[Work]] done on a object. To calulate, we take
$$\int \vec F\cdot\vec T\space ds=\int\vec F \cdot\frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt=\int\vec F\cdot d\vec r \space$$It's counterpart is [[Flux]].
