[[Rust]]'s assosiated system that in general replaces [[Pointer]]s in other languages is called borrowing. A borrow is essentially a promise to a highe rlevel scope that when the lower level object obtains the borrowed [[Variable]], it will return it, without deleting it, at the end of it's execution.
