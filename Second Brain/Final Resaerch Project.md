# Ghist
Comparing [[Wisconsin Fast Plant]]s grown in different environments, comparing phenotypes.

#lab_project

# Steps
1. Research [[Wisconsin Fast Plant]]
2. Take notes on G. Rate, Sow Depth, ectl
3. Decide conditions of growth
4. Decide phenotypes/ (3 of choice at least)
5. Run Trial

| Feature              | Result                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Research Question    | How does different levels of salt effects the growth      |
| Hypothesis           | Incread levels of salt will inhibit growth of the plant   |
| Indipendant Variable | Salt content of water                                     |
| Dependent Variable   | Growth of plant                                           |
| Control variables    | Amount of soil and water, sun exposure                    |
| Measured Variables   | Height, girth of stem, number of leaves, C. concentration |
| Analysis             | Box Chart and T-Test                                      |
|                      |                                                           |
