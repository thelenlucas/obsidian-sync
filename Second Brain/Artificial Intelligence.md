# Ghist
Relates to the study, theory, and construction of intelligences of human construction. Is an incompleted field, while [[ANI]]s have been constructed, [[AGI]] and [[ASI]] are still out of sight.

Part of a series on #Computer_Science/Machine_Learning 

# Categories
1. [[ANI]]: Artificial Narrow Intelligence. Can perform a single task, or subset of small tasks, at or better than a human expert. Most [[computer]] programs today are a form of ANI
2. [[AGI]]: General Intelligence. Can perform *any* human level task at expert or higher level. Unconstructed, probably possible
3. [[ASI]]: Super Intelligence. Validity and possibility still under debate.

# Approches
1. [[Symbol-Sytem AI]]
2. [[Connectionist AI]]
3. [[Artificial Life]]
