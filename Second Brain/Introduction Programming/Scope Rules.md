WIthin [[Computer Science]], Scope affects which variables are "in play". Usually, variables create within a function may only be acessed inside that function, and [[Computer Science Theory/Function]]s  may not look "above" themselves for data values. Variables modified via [[Call By Value]] will also not be effected outside of a function, though [[Call by Reference]] will be, and may be used to "break" scoping rules.
