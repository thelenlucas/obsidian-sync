In [[C++]] [[String]]s are mutable, thank god. They have several methods

* length() returns the length of a string. is the same as size()
* find() returns the index of the instance of the item submitted, starting at the second value's location
* substr() returns a value of arg2 length starting at arg1
* at(i) returns char at string[i]
* insert() inserts a string before position indicated
* replace() functions same as insert but replaces characters
* append() adds a string to the end of the appended
