A proposition is a [[Logic]]al statment that can be either true or false. It must be true or false and no other values. It's used extensively as a component of [[Computer Science]] and [[Computer Engineering]].

Compound propositions may be constructed with [[Boolean Operators]]. For example, a porposition could be "This flower is blue **and** has a stem". Thus we might say the [[Set]] $$\mathbb{F}=\{x:x\in\mathbb{B}\wedge x\in\mathbb{S}\}$$
