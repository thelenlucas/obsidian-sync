Evolutionary algorithms are a novel subeset of [[Machine Learning]] that uses random variations and fitness scores (usually arranged via a [[Cost Function]]), to determine, select, and reproduce short segments of data that perform better to a certain problem.

It is very useful for problems with no trivial cost function solution, but individual segments will very often branch off into non-useful portions of the problem space, and will remain there.
