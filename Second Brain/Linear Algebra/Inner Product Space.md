# Ghist
Four axioms that let operations happen on vectors within a product space. In the **Euclidian**(Real) space, this is the dot product.

## Definition
Let $u,v,w$ be vectors in $V$, and let $c$ be any scalar. An inner product on $V$ is a function that assosiates a real number $(u,v)$ with each pair of $u$ and $v$ and satisfies all four axioms.

# Axioms
1. $<u,v> = <v,u>$ - **Symetry Axiom**
2. $<u+v,w> = <u,w>+<v,w>$ - **Additivity Axiom**
3. $<ku,v> = k<u,v>$ - **Homogony Axiom**
4. $<v,v>\ge0\text{ and }<v,v>=0 \text{ only if }v=0$ - **Positivity Axiom**

# Applications
* Linear Regression
* Time Series Analysis
* Linear/Quad Approximation
* Cross Product
	* Area of Paralellagram
* Orthogonal projection
