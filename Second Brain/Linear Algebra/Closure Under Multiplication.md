In [[Linear Algebra]], one of the axioms we must prove to establish a [[Vector Space]] is closure under multiplication. 

For some set $V$, $V$ is only a [[Vector Space]] if for every contained item $u$, $cu$ is in $V$ for every scalar. For example$$W=\{[x_{1},x_{2}]\in R^{@},x_1\geq0\}$$does not comply with closure under multlipication, becasuse $c=-5$ is a valid statment, and that may let $x_{1}<0$, which is not allowed under this set. Meanwhile the set $$W=\{(x_{1,}x_{2}, x_{3},0):x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\in R\}$$Is closed under multiplication.
