A [[Vector Space]] can have a sub-set of another vector space. If it qualifies, it is thus called a [[Subspace]]. Subspaces must qualify in several axioms, for the subspace $H$ of $V$:

1. The [[Zero Vector]] of $V$ is in $H$
2. For every $u$ and $v$ in $H$, $u+v$ is in $H$ (Closed under vector addition)
3. For each $u$ in $H$ and each scalar value $c$, $cu$ is in $H$ ([[Closure Under Multiplication]])

# Examples

## EX-1

$$W=\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ a-2b & 0 \\ 0 & c \\ \end{bmatrix}$$
* $u$ is nonemtpy
* $\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ a-2b & 0 \\ 0 & c \\ \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}s & q \\ s-2q & 0 \\ 0 & p \\ \end{bmatrix}$ remains real
* $c*\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ a-2b & 0 \\ 0 & c \\ \end{bmatrix}$ remains real
