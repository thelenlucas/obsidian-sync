In [[Linear Algebra]], [[Vector]]'s may be constructed as multiples of scaled unit vectors, such as $$v=3i+j$$representing$$v=<3,1>$$A big part of linear algebra is that any vector in the $R^2$ space may be reached via one of these [[Linear Combination]]s. You can alos create a vector btween the tips of any two vectors  by creating a linear combination of two vectors, unless those vectors are multiples of one another or they both are the [[Zero Vector]]. This reach is called the Span of the vectors. We usually repersent this as points, and of course for msot vecotrs, the entire [[2-D Space]]. 

We can generalize this to [[3-D Space]] with two vectors, which creates a plane. With three [[Vector]]s, this becomes a plane if one vector is the multiple of another, or the third vector creates the entire [[3-D Space]]. 

When one of these vectors is "redundant" via multiplicity, they are said to be [[Linearly Dependant]]. When they are not, they are [[Linearrly Indipendant]]. THerefor it can be said that the [[Basis]] of the space is the space is dependant on the dependance of the [[Vector]]s present.
