When speaking of [[Vector Field]]s and [[Line Integral]]s, we sometimes would like to find how strong a vector field "fights" against a path, similar to [[Flow]] and how it alings with the path. To do this, we may take the integral of the [[Vector Field]] or [[Force Field]] against the [[Line Integral]]. To this effect we may take $$\int \vec F \cdot \vec n=\int\vec F\cdot(T \times k)$$
