# Linear Regression Functions

Part of a series on #machine_learning 

A type of [[Machine Learning]] algorithm that takes a vector of inputs, and assums a linear relation between them and the output factor. Takes the form of $$y(x_n)=p_0+p_1x_1+p_2x_2+...+p_nx_n$$Has the advantage of being able to analyze features sets of indefinite size, with a trivial [[Gradient Descent]] partial solution, but begins to fail when linear relationships cannot be found.
