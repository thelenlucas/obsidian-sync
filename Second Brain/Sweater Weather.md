[Intro]
C Am Em G x2

[Verse 1]
C Am
All I am is a man
Em G
I want this world in my hands
C
I hate the beach
Am Em
But I stand in California
G
with my toes in the sand
C
Use the sleeves on my sweater
Am
Let's have an adventure
Em G
Head in the clouds, my gravity's centered
C Am
Touch my neck, yeah, and I'll touch yours
Em G
You in those little high-waisted shorts

[Pre-Chorus]
C
Oh woah, she knows what I think about
Am
And what I think about
Em
One love, two mouths
G
One love, one house
C
No shirt, no blouse
Am
Just us, you find out
Em G
Yeah, nothing

[Chorus]
C Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa-oh
Em
For you here
G
And now
C Am
So let me hold whoa-oh
Em G
Both your hands in the holes (of my sweater)

[Verse 2]
C
And if I may just take your breath away
Am
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Em
The silence guides our minds
G
to move to a place so far away
C
The goosebumps start to raise
Am Em
When my left hand meets your waist, yeah
then I watch your face
G C
Oh-oh, I watch your face, yeah
These hearts adore
Am
All the other beats hardest for
Em
Inside this place is warm
G N.C. C
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Coming down
Am
One love, two mouths
Em
One love, one house
G
No shirt, no blouse
C Am
Just us, you find out, yeah
Em G
Nothing at all, oh no

[Chorus]
C Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa-oh
Em
For you here
G
Right now
C Am
So let me hold whoa-oh
Em G
Both your hands in the holes
C Am
'Cause it's too cold whoa-oh
Em
For you here
G
And now
C Am
So let me hold whoa-oh
Em G
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
D
Oh no no, no no no

For you here
